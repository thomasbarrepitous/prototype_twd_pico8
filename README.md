# prototype_twd_pico8

-- CONCEPT --

This is a prototype of a future game made on Pico8.
This project is a part of my internship abroad at the University of Tsukuba (筑波大学), Japan proposed by the IUT Computer Science Department of Bordeaux.

The subject of this internship is "Game Development". 

Our goal is to create a video game from scratch using Java or LUA and understand the process of creating a video game.

This project is supervised by Claus Aranha, professor at the University of Tsukuba and in colaboration with Nathan Lesne also from the same Computer Science department.

-- THE CODE --

I'm relatively new in the GitHub community and I don't really know anything about the licenses etc ...
So this code is completly open-source but I don't think everyone will ever read this anyway.

-- THANK YOU --

If you checked this README you are interested in my work, I really appreciate that you're taking your time to see what I made.

Thank you.

Thomas Barré-Pitous.
